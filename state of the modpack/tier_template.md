This can be any links, including but not limited to:

- Google Sheets spreadsheets

- Wiki links

Anything that makes it easier for other developers to understand options at this tier

# 4. Player Experience Notes
Information attributed (signed here, discord permalink, etc.) about some key bottlenecks in the tier, tradeoffs between different options, player experience, alternative options, etc. This is of course subjective, but in aggregate can signal information about QoL and usability.

eg.
(OrderedSet) - If you pick a full craft automation system at this tier, you pick either Logistics Pipes or PR:Transporation. It seems like Logistics Pipes is the more broadly popular option, perhaps due to overall greater external popularity or quality of life issues I have heard about PRT ([and wrote about here](https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Red_Transportation_-_MV_Storage_and_Autocrafting#PRT's_Sharp_Corners)]).
(StargatePlayerXYZ) - We ended up never using machine X because it seemed obseleted by other machine Y. Getting Tiberium was super difficult because of XYZ. We had to mega parallelize machine Z to reasonably finish some task R in time - we did 1000x UHV machines and it took a week.
