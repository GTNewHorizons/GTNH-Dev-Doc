# 4. Player Experience Notes
Information attributed (signed here, discord permalink, etc.) about some key bottlenecks in the tier, tradeoffs between different options, player experience, alternative options, etc. This is of course subjective, but in aggregate can signal information about QoL and usability.

eg.
(MadWizard) Wings are bad, they do not consistently trigger on all falls
