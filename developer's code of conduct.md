# GTNH Developer’s Code of Conduct and Contribution Guidelines

## Behavior
Any GT:NH dev must be respectful to anyone on the GitHub, and in Discord, or any other place where they might represent the GT:NH project (no insulting, no maliciously trolling, no looking down on the others etc). Basically, don't be a jerk. In particular, no insulting other developers if they do not agree with your ideas, and vice versa. This can be a reason to be demoted, no matter your contributions to the pack.

## Documentation in PR
To improve review quality, in PR about new feature/feature change/balance changes, you should always explain what you are doing in the PR, and why you did it. The more precise your description, the better, as it helps to decide if the change is ok or not. Screenshots and videos are a bonus, as they can directly be copy/pasted in #upcoming-features. Titles should be written as if they are to be read from a changelog, given that is how it is autogenerated (context is important!), About the commits, prefer multiple short ones over one big commit, and name them in such way that they are reflective of your changes.

## Content creation
1) You should avoid touching areas of the pack you have never reached personally as a player, unless you have feedback from other devs/players who are experienced in those areas.
2) You should avoid adding new content below IV tier, the game is already dense enough as it is (especially the chemlines!). However, bug fixes and QoL changes are always appreciated. If you have a good reason to add it, discuss with the team in #meta-dev, and if general consensus is reached, then you can start working on it. This is important! We don’t want anyone to waste dev time on PRs that will get rejected.
3) Don't make PRs with new stuff if it hasn't been discussed with the team before. We had enough occurrences of that in the pack, where it is merged without anyone but the one who coded the PR knowing precisely what the changes are about, resulting in awful discoveries once it's shipped to the players.
4) Respect the vision. If something you want to add is not in the vision document then discuss it in #meta-dev and if there is agreement the document can be updated.
5) Be open to criticism. Sometimes the stuff you made and that you are proud of might not be popular in its current form. That's ok and it's a part of the process.
6) Include a flowchart if it involves adding a new recipe chain. Any new PR without it will be rejected no matter how good it can be. If you don’t know how, try [draw.io](https://draw.io).

## Balancing PRs
They must follow the vision we have, and follow 4. of the Content Section. A PR affecting balancing should always be labeled as such, and not be mixed in with other unrelated changes in the same PR. For IV and below, follow 2. of the Content creation section. For LuV and above, it must at least have 2 approvals, and one of them must be a member of the github's admin team (list of them [here](https://github.com/orgs/GTNewHorizons/teams/admin)).

When a PR is tagged as a balance affecting PR (currently "Affects Balance"), devs are required to answer the following questions to clarify their viewpoint and make discussion easier, as well as document discussions that may have happened in Discord (hard to search). Similar to recipe chains, any new balance PR made without answering the questions will be rejected no matter how good it is. Devs are not required to have perfect answers for all questions (eg some meta changes are difficult to know), but an attempt should be made at answering each:
1. What goal is this change trying to achieve? What tier is it targeting?
2. What side effects does this have on other lines/systems?
3. If relevant, do you have any metrics or a spreadsheet/visualization explaining your change? If it is a new multiblock, could you provide a picture of it and/or a practical setup? This may help us understand it better.
4. Is this change made in expectation or in tandem with another unwritten or unmerged change coming later?

The question requirement may be bypassed in reasonable scenarios, such as emergency reverts.
