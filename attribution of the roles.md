# Attribution of the roles

This document will explain various roles on Discord, what are their consequences inside the NH organisation and how to obtain them.
Here is the list of roles covered by this document:

- Admins
- GT:NH Staff
- GT:NH Staff on sabatical
- GT:NH Dev / GT:NH Dev on Hiatus
- Stargate Tier
- Gatefinity Tier
- GT:NH Gods
- GT:NH Texture Creator
- Official Quest Editor
- MC Dev
- GT:NH Contributor
- Content Creator
- Wiki Editor
- Unofficial GT:NH Servers
- Beta Tester
- Donator

For the others, either they are self attributable, or they are delivered at team members' discretion.

## Admins
They are 3 of them:
- DreamMasterXXL, leader of the GT:NH project. He's the one who decides when to do new releases.
- Namikon, responsible for the backbone of the GT:NH infrastructure (jenkins server, official servers, donations, ...)
- boubou_19, community manager, and responsible for various daily sysadmin tasks, such as handling the official servers.

There is absolutely no plan to add another admin for now.

## GT:NH Staff
Core members of the NH team. they are chosen by admins, and their philosophy is that they will ask worthy members if they want to become a team member, based on one's skills or to thank them for their very hard work. An eliminating criteria is that if you ask to become a GT:NH Staff member, you just ruined your chances to become one.
GT:NH Staff can be broken down in the following categories:
 - Github Admin
	For those involved in the github management.
 - Moderator
	For those involved in the moderation of the Discord server.
 - Official Servers Operator
	For those involved in the official server management.
A GT:NH Staff can be in multiple categories, as they like.

## GT:NH Staff on sabatical
This is for GT:NH Staff members who can't fullfill their duties. They are discharged from all of their responsabilities until they come back.

## GT:NH Dev / GT:NH Dev on Hiatus
The GT:NH devs are those who are responsible for pack's development. To become a dev, you must be a regular contributor and your name must be recommended among the devs / team members. Then a vote is made internally to decide if you get promoted. You also get a dev cape if you wish. **GT:NH devs must abide by the Developer's code of conduct! In particular the section about the behavior, because they represent the pack. No matter your contributions, you can be demoted if you don't follow this section.**
The GT:NH dev on Hiatus is just a role devs can ask for if they want to indicate they won't be active for an undefined period for whatever reason they want. But they can still contribute to pack dev even on hiatus if they want.

## Stargate Tier
You can ask for this tier if you succeeded in completing the Stargate in your run following [these rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iww1FNLkCuun6s6LW7Q6_1Z1aldtxYeRxYOeq_P-vK8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Gatefinity Tier
You can ask for this tier if you succeeded in completing the Stargate twice following [these rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iww1FNLkCuun6s6LW7Q6_1Z1aldtxYeRxYOeq_P-vK8/edit?usp=sharing).

## GT:NH Gods
You can ask for this tier if you succeeded in completing the Stargate 3 times following [these rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iww1FNLkCuun6s6LW7Q6_1Z1aldtxYeRxYOeq_P-vK8/edit?usp=sharing).

## GT:NH Texture Creator
This role is made for those who are willing to make new textures for NH. You get access to a channel where the devs ask for textures. You are under no obligation to provide a texture, but if you want to contribute artistically this is a great way to help!

## Official Quest Editor
If you are very active into quest proofreading/editing or into the creation of quests, this role is made for you. You'll get this role only if you get recommended by a GT:NH dev or higher.

## MC Dev
If you are a known dev of a mod (used or not in NH), you can ask to get this role.

## GT:NH Contributor
If you are interested in such role that is the GT:NH Contributor role, you must at least perform 3 pull requests on any repository under the GT:NH organisation on GitHub. **A contributor must abide by the Developer's code of conduct, or their contributions will be rejected!**

## Content Creator
Content Creator role is deserved to those who are regularly making content about the GT:NH modpack (series or streams for instance). Ask a team member to get the role if you posted content but don't have the role already.

## Wiki Editor
Wiki Editors are people actively invested in wiki contributions. It's a role given to reward the efforts made. Wiki Editors have also a stronger weight in decisions concerning the wiki, like shaping, etc. If you think someone deserves the role, don't hesitate to recommend it to team members. boubou_19 is the Bureaucrat of the GT:NH wiki. For deep changes to the wiki, make a request to him.

## Unofficial GT:NH Servers
You automatically have this role if you are in the admin team of one of the servers listed in multiplayer by default. If you are part of the admin team of such server but you don't have the role, tell someone in your team which has it to DM a team member, we will fix this. When you have this role, you automatically gain access to channels to discuss about exploits or sysadmin stuff.

## Beta Tester
Beta tester role is a role handed out by team members to those who are willing to play on experimental versions of the pack and report bugs. Just ask for the role and you'll have it. But keep in mind that we periodically purge people from this role every few months, because we want active testers. Also, please, pretty please, don't ask it just to have a fancy color on the discord. This unlocks a new channel made for beta testing.

## Donator
Donator is a role handed out after someone has made a donation the NH Project [here](https://gtnewhorizons.buycraft.net/). After the donation, ask DreamMasterXXL or boubou_19 to give you the role by providing your minecraft username as well.
