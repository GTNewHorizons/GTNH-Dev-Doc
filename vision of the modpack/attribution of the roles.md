# Attribution of the roles

This document will explain various roles on Discord, what are their consequences inside the NH organisation and how to obtain them.
Here is the list of roles covered by this document:

- Team Member
- GT:NH Dev / GT:NH Dev on Hiatus
- GT:NH Texture Creator
- Official Quest Editor
- MC Dev
- GT:NH Contributor
- Content Creator
- Wiki Editor
- Unofficial GT:NH Servers
- Beta tester
- Donator

For the others, either they are self attribuable, or they are delivered at team members' discretion.

## Admins
They are 3 of them:
- DreamMasterXXL, leader of the GT:NH project. He's the one who decides when to do new releases.
- Namikon, responsible for the backbone of the GT:NH infrastructure (jenkins server, official servers, donations, ...)
- boubou_19, community manager, and responsible for various daily sysadmin tasks, such has handling the official servers.

There is absolutely no plan to add another admin for now.

## Team Member
Core members of the NH team. they are chosen by admins, and their philosophy is that they will ask worthy members if they want to become a team member, based on one's skills or to thank them for their very hard work. An eliminating criteria is that if you ask to become a team member, you just ruined your chances to become one. Team members can then decide if they want to be labeled as Staff or Moderator, to indicate if they are more into the stuff gravitating around NH or more into the discord as a whole. They have the exact same perks in any case.

## GT:NH Dev / GT:NH Dev on Hiatus
The GT:NH devs are those who are responsible for pack's development. To become a dev, you must be a regular contributor and your name must be recommanded among the devs / team members. Then a vote is made internally to decide if you get promoted. You also get a dev cape if you wish. **GT:NH devs must abide by the Developer's code of conduct! In particular the section about the behavior, because they represent the pack. No matter your contributions, you can be demoted if you don't follow this section.**
The GT:NH dev on Hiatus is just a role devs can ask for if they want to indicate they won't be active for an undefined period for whatever reason they want. But they can still contribute to pack dev even on hiatus if they want.

## GT:NH Texture Creator
This role is made for those who are willing to make new textures for NH. You get access to a channel where the devs ask for textures.

## Official Quest Editor
If you are very active into quest proofreading/editing or into the creation of quests, this role is made for you. You'll get this role only if you get recommanded by a GT:NH dev or higher.

## MC Dev
If you are a known dev of a mod (used or not in NH), you can ask to get this role.

## GT:NH Contributor
If you are interested in such role that is the GT:NH Contributor role, you must at least perform 3 pull requests on any repository under the GT:NH organisation on github. **A contributor must abide by the Developper's code of conduct!, or their contributions will be rejected.**

## Content Creator
Content Creator role is deserved to those who are regularly making content about the GT:NH modpack (series or streams for instance). Ask a team member to get the role if you posted content but don't have the role already. 

## Wiki Editor
Wiki Editors are people actively invested in wiki contributions. It's a role given to reward the efforts made. Wiki Editors have also a stronger weight in decisions concerning the wiki, like shaping, etc. If you think someone deserves the role, don't hesitate to recommand it to team members. boubou_19 is the Bureaucrat of the GT:NH wiki. For deep changes to the wiki, make a request to him.

## Unofficial GT:NH Servers
You automatically have this role if you are in the admin team of one of the servers listed in multiplayer by default. If you are part of the admin team of such server but you don't have the role, tell someone in your team which has it to DM a team member, we will fix this. When you have this role, you automatically gain access to channels to discuss about exploits or sysadmin stuff.

## Beta tester
Beta tester role is a role handed out by team members to those who are willing to play on experimental versions of the pack and report bugs. Just ask for the role and you'll have it. But keep in mind that we periodically purge people from this role every few monthes, because we want active testers. Also, please, pretty please, don't ask it just to have a fancy color on the discord. This unlocks a new channel made for beta testing.

## Donator
Donator is a role handed out after someone has made a donation to the NH Project. They unlock some cosmetic perks on the official servers if they play there, as well as a cape anyone playing NH will see if they are in multiplayer. For now, the donations are closed, sorry for the inconvenience.
