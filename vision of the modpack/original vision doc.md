# 1. Definitions
## 1.i. What is GT:NH?
<div align="justify">
From the GitHub and for discussion:

You are looking at a big progressive kitchensink pack for Minecraft 1.7.10 balanced around the mod GregTech.

Over 8 years of development (and still going) GT:NH has formed a balance and refinement that only a handful of packs can keep up with. We are talking about thousands of recipe tweaks, a massive questbook with a custom reward system, unique world generation, custom mods coded for the pack, custom Thaumonomicon pages, and many more.

The main intentions of the pack are a long-lasting experience and tying mods together in a progressive fashion, making it feel more like a single game than a compilation of mods thrown together.

To reach this goal, GT New Horizons is using the tiers (basically ages of technology) from GregTech and allocates content of other mods to a fitting point within the progression.

Starting in the stone age you will barely be able to survive until you get your first steam machines and, eventually, reach electricity. Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.

If you are a fan of expert mode packs and want to take it to the next level this pack will be your friend!
</div>

## 1.ii. What is a tier?
<div align="justify">
Currently the QB “opens the next tier” usually when you can build the machine hull for that tier (MV opens with an MV Machine Hull). It appears to progress through machines and new processes of that tier, culminating in (often) a new dimension/planet you visit to get new materials to build the requirements for the next tier.

Circuit tiers are relatively well defined but don’t really correspond to “QB” tiers (a machine may have an  LV hull and take an MV circuit, and in HV you build LuV circuits).

Another common theme is materials that are hard to get in one tier (for example, only available as small ore, need strange processing, etc) become easier to obtain in a later tier. Titanium for example. However, it is likely that  the “easier” path needs an appropriate line - you can get small amounts of platinum but you’re going to need a platline eventually.

Tier materials are used to gate content, by requiring a titanium plate, for example, a thaumcraft item can be restricted until you can obtain at least some titanium.
</div>

## 1.iii. What is Pollution?
### 1.iii.a. Current Pollution
<div align="justify">
Pollution should be something that slowly stacks up when a player doesn’t use “green” ways of doing some stuff and decreases when the player uses “green” ways. It’s the result of player interactions with the world. Pollution must also be scaled with the industrialization level reached by the player. That means a stone age player shouldn’t even be able to reach the same levels of pollution as a HV player, unless the stone age player spams the polluting objects in its world.

Pollution must become annoying after the player has reached a certain point, and worsening its effects the more it raises. This annoyingness starts by affecting the landscape: slowly deperishing plants, decaying grass/dirt into sand, impacting the visibility (fog/pollution particles).Then, it starts impacting the living creature themselves by giving them effects randomly: nausea, slowness and poisoning. In the meantime, given that something healing the livings hurts the undeads and vice versa , it should also buff the mobs in the polluted chunks. The strength of the buffs/debuffs should be based on the pollution level.

- But pollution must be something the player can counter by various mechanisms:
- If a player stops his whole industry, the pollution should dissipate more or less fast. If the pollution levels are stable, then it would take more time to dissipate than a burst of pollution. Also, high and stable levels of pollution should dissipate faster than low and stable levels of pollution.
- The player can wear a hazmat suit for low and moderate amounts of pollution to stop getting the debuffs. For high and insane levels of pollution, due to the rarefaction of O2 in the air, the player must also wear equipment to breathe in the polluted environment.
- The player can actively reduce pollution by using Electric air filters to clean the pollution. This multiblock would suck air around it and collect pollution. It would also be possible to hook up pipes to get the air rejections of the multi.
- The player can (to some extent) plant trees to reduce the pollution a bit when it is at a low or moderate level.
- Other new ways of dealing with pollution than by air???

The collected pollution would be available under some kind of dust and also under some kind of mixed gasses. You would need to separate the gasses and the dusts to make them valuable resources (recycling carbon monoxide for some other recipes,getting some rare gasses from the pollution, making some kind of cheap fertilizer from the nitrogen-based byproduct you would get from the dusts, collecting carbon under solid form, ….)

Muffler hatches should have their effect diminish over time when it starts to clog up because of the pollution accumulating on it. That means that it exhausts less and less pollution until it’s totally clogged up. Higher tier mufflers would clog up slower, incentivizing the players to upgrade it. In addition to that, the higher tier the muffler hatch is, the lower the amount of pollution is released in the environment by the actual multi, incentivizing even more the upgrade of them. Also, a player could totally avoid the multi releasing pollution by piping the muffler hatch into new sealed pipes, so the player can deal and reprocess the gasses into valuable resources, but that doesn”t avoid the muffler hatch from clogging up, to really keep the incentive of upgrading the muffler hatches.

Multiblocks using muffler hatches should have an additional maintenance message in addition to the 6 maintenance messages already present in the game. However, while those 6 maintenance messages are totally random and just decrease the efficiency of the multiblock, this one would appear with 5 variants (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% clogged), indicating in the multiblock GUI the level of clogging. If the 100% threshold is reached, then the multiblock instantly stops, voiding the recipe in the process. Also, the level of clogging would be available by using the tricorder to get more precise levels. A clogging cover could also be made, so players can have an analog redstone signal indicating the level of pollution stuck into the muffler hatch. It would also be possible inside the GUI of the cover to set up the threshold starting from which you emit redstone, like item and fluid detection cover.

Solar panels (block and cover forms) should see their efficiency decreasing over time, due to dust. It would be possible to clean it up when using a bucket of water (or any fluid container holding 1 kL of water) to clean it up. Also, if the solar is exposed to rain, it should clean itself a tiny bit every couple of seconds, making it worth having rain for some time. (applicable also to the solar boilers). The clogging cover would also apply to the solars.

In addition to the tricorder that is able to detect pollution precisely in the chunk but requires the player interaction, the player should have other ways of detecting pollution. This is why a new pollution detection cover should be introduced. It would be available for each tier starting from LV. This would return an analog redstone signal based on the pollution levels. Of course, the full strength redstone signal would be output for the max threshold the cover can detect, saturating after that threshold. So only the threshold would increase. It would also be possible inside the GUI of the cover to set up the threshold starting from which you emit redstone, like item and fluid detection cover.
</div>

### 1.iii.b. Pollution 2.0
<div align="justify">
Yannick suggested rebrand: Environment crafting. Craft the environment of your choice using side effects from a variety of sources. Each environment combination has cons you can mitigate and pros you can benefit from.

Possible sources of environment:
- Industrial waste
    - At what tier this environment is unlocked:
        - stone age
    - How to get this environment:
        - Run everything that is based on combustion to slowly decrease the air quality
    - What are the advantages of it:
        - One can use a yet to be defined pollution recycling chain to obtain various resources, some of them being easier to get through that route
        - Free buff at negative pollution
            - E.g. Jump Boost at -250000 gibble
            - Definitively no buff at -1 gibble
        - Random “positive” SFX, e.g. bird sing.
    - What are the downsides of it:
        - It impacts the air quality, creating a more or less dense fog
        - It is harder to breath in such environment, so you get various debuffs such as nausea, poison, slowness…
        - it impacts all forms of plant life: crops, tree leaves, flowers, they all will slowly fade away and disappear.
        - It obstructs any solar panels/boilers, making them lose efficiency gradually over time. To clean them, a manual intervention from the player is required, in the form of right-clicking with any fluid container having water inside it (minimum 1 bucket of water?)
    - Visual effects:
        - Fog effect
        - Soot particles
        - Grass based blocks changing colors
        - Skybox got a yellow to brownish tint
    - Ways to deal with such an environment:
        - Air quality:
            - Electric air filter (starting from LV): They exist in 3 forms: one available in LV, one in HV, one in EV/IV. See the quest related to it in multiblock goals for more information
            - Muffler hatches (related to multies, starting from LV): they are filtering more or less the air pollution output by the multi
            - Diffusion (available from stone age): Displace the  waste by piping it in chunks further away, or by funneling it into smokestacks that make released pollution spread (and thus dissipate) faster.
            - Pollution detector covers(starting from LV, not yet implemented):these covers would return an analog signal based on the pollution in the air. Each tier has a detection limit, after which the cover saturates and emits max strength redstone signal. From the cover GUI, one could define a threshold between 0 and the max detected by the cover, working as a high pass/low pass detection, just like the energy cover, item detection cover or the fluid detection cover.
        - How does this scale through tiers?

- Magical environment
    - How to get this environment:
    - What are the advantages of it:
        - Might be required for certain magical rituals
        - Essentia Discount for infusion
    - What are the downsides of it:
        - Taint?
        - Wisps?
    - Visual effects:
    - Ways to deal with such an environment:

- Radioactive environment
    - How to get this environment:
        - Nuclear incident
        - Exploitation costs of a nuclear reactor
        - Usage of a nuke
    - What are the advantages of it:
        - Increased mutation rates for trees/bees/crops/botany flowers
        - Accelerated plant growth
    - What are the downsides of it:
        - Malfunction of non-shielded computing equipment?
        - Getting irradiated without hazmat like protection
        - Chances of decaying a block?
        - Mutation rate boost and growing boosts come at the cost of increasing the chances of dying
    - Visual effects:
        - Blindness? (radiation can turn people blind irl)
            - Yannick: Might this not make someone incapable of resolving a bad radiation situation?
    - Ways to deal with such an environment:

- Electromagnetic environment
    - How to get this environment:
        - Yannick: Could potentially be generated by any sufficiently high tier multi while active, as an "upper tier" alternative to air pollution?
    - What are the advantages of it:
        - Some kinds of low-power devices can draw free passive power from the environment OR DISADVANTAGE: fry or disable low-power devices in the area (Depends on what you're typically trying to achieve when generating this environment)
        - Some magical rituals might be simpler. (Free infusion stability?)
        - Free normal to magnetic metal conversion?
            - Yannick: This is also simultaneously a con since magnetic metal doesn't have the same recipes, and you might not want your metal converted.
        - What are the downsides of it:
            - You can get electrical damages if you are too close to a leak
        - Visual effects:
            - If feasible, electric arcs between metal blocks
        - Ways to deal with such an environment:

## 1.iv. What is Tedium?
<div>
A process that is required but is not fun. Something may be fun to figure out the first time (redstone anti-void for a multiblock) but soon becomes tedious the fifty-seventh time you have to set it up on an LCR. This can be solved by tiering (for example, maintenance hatches go from manual to duct tape to toolboxes to automated to fully automated).

A process that is long and RNG filled. Crops for example are generally considered more tedious than bees, because you have to babysit them and wait for RNG. Splitting up the steps necessary may help (many people don’t do anything crop or bee until they NEED something) - so making it desirable to do some of the basics earlier could reduce that load.

A process that only prevents a negative aspect. Warp, for example, is balanced by the good things you’re getting (and can be avoided by avoiding those things), but pollution solution has “no advantage” except reduction of negative effects, and so many disable it.

A process that encourages extensive AFK so machines can run. You could survive on a single BBF, but it should be encouraged to instead build more. This can be at odds with other tedium as often you can avoid certain tedium by just setting something up and letting it run AFK.

A process the user has to do to get the best gameplay, but isn’t directly part of the game. For example, marking waypoints for ores, nodes, etc.

A boss fight that is extremely long but without any skill, damaging them for three points a hit for five hours.

Should tedium be accepted/permitted for situations “outside of normal gameplay” - for example, is tedium associated with a no-rocket-run acceptable?
</div>

## 1.v. What is QoL?
<div align="justify">
Quality of Life is often using the pack code to automate “tedium” away - for example before VisualProspecting almost everyone would manually waypoint ore locations - something that is handled by VisualProspecting.

Tools like NEI are an important part of QoL as it helps you find what you need.

Additional QoL items include the questbook which lets you know about new things that can help your playthrough, along with UI improvements that reveal functionality.

QoL should usually not be gated behind some certain tier. Trying to do so must have a strong rationale behind it to justify it, e.g. the QoL completely eliminates a previous mechanism (though at that point it’d be worth considering if this existing mechanism needs tweaking)
</div>

## 1.vi. What should be Magic?
<div align="justify">
Magic is concepts and mechanisms tailored under a magic theme. Instead of the “tech” they focus more on utility than progressing through the tiers. Examples are armor, tools, survival, teleport and whatnot.

Magic can assist in progressing through the tiers, but it should not be the primary gating mechanism of any tier (unless this tier is solely for more advanced magic). In simpler terms, one should be able to reach the end of the tech tree without doing any magic.

Advancement in Tech should assist in the development of magic, e.g. a ZPM player should receive some kind of boost to speed up/catch up development in magic if he wanted to. Do note these boosts should not eventually give birth to the meme of Hold off doing magic until UHV when you get to one click unlock everything.

Magic Mods should be kept relatively distinct, with optional cross-over instead of treating everything as a Thaumcraft Addon and requiring Infusion (as an example).
</div>

## 1.vii. What should be space exploration?
<div align="justify">
From GitHub: “Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.”

Currently you go to space to get plans for the next rocket and to get minerals (no-rocket-runs to the side).

Question: Are no-rocket-runs an intended path for the pack?
</div>

### 1.vii.a. Yannick suggestion: Leapfrogging

<div align="justify">
In order to reach ever further into space, you need to build a network of space stations and ground stations with launch and refueling facilities. Basically encourage having to build some kind of a presence on those worlds. Those outposts could be thought of as a level of complexity above multis because they need to be mini-bases, and each tier should have new requirements to keep the challenge fresh.

You could also gate more mod content behind those planets. Could portals to certain dimensions only be openable from the right planets? Could certain aspects of magic mods also only exist in other worlds? Getting players to play longer on each planet gives you an opportunity to do stuff like having tougher mobs on every tier, to give a use to your ever more powerful offensive capabilities.

</div>

## 1.viii. What is the place of combat in the pack?
<div align=justify>

</div>

## 1.vix. What's our policy to add new mods?
<div align="justify">
All new mods must be Open Source with few-to-no exceptions.
Large mods must not only be “thematically appropriate” but also have a champion willing to work with the team both on development and balance.
Unless (and perhaps even) if actively under development, a fork shall be created in our repo.
</div>

## 1.x. What is the deprecation policy on removed or "nerfed" recipes?
<div align="justify">
Many if not most players don’t follow GitHub development closely, and can be surprised by changes such as new lines (Aluminum, eg). This can result in already existing lines having to be revisited, which can be tedious. 

Perhaps there should be a two step process:
New line is added with additional steps vs current setup (but also advantages of some kind). Previous recipes are hidden in NEI but remain functional. QB is updated (perhaps there should be an in-game QB chapter for major changes?)
Next release the recipes are removed

This wouldn’t apply to unintentional recipes/exploits
</div>

## 1.xi. General Principles
- Avoid small/tiny dusts if possible - percentage chance of full dusts instead
- Avoid making new features that encourage spamming laggy setup.

# 2. Tech Tree
## 2.i. Stone Age
<div align="justify">
This is the player’s first exposure to the pack and its philosophies, so it is important to ensure that any information is as clear as it can be.

In this tier, the player is introduced to tool progression and how it applies to mining. Also present is the player’s first exposure to GT ore veins.

It is worth noting that the player will find themselves almost 100% relying on the Quest Book to figure out what to do next for the early survival portions of this tier.

New players who know modded Minecraft should be strongly reminded that the QB has all the changes in gameplay.

Major milestone:
- Getting a tool material
- Cook some bronze

Major challenges:
- Surviving the night
- Basic food source
- Get basic tools
- A residence

Optional challenges:
- Conquer overworld dungeons

Main materials: Flint, later Iron (both mainly for tools)
</div>

## 2.ii. Steam Age
<div align="justify">
This gives the player insight into the method in which GT operates for tiering and material processing, which is also applicable for all tiers after. This makes it an important tier to ensure the player understands such information properly.

The major milestones for this tier include:
- Building the Bricked Blast Furnace
- Reaching the Nether
- First circuits

Major challenges:
- Stable steam production

Optional challenges:
- Conquer overworld dungeons
- Establish a steady charcoal supply

End of tier: built first electric machine

Main materials: Bronze (machines), later Steel (advanced TiCon tools)
</div>

## 2.iii. LV Age
<div align="justify">
By this point the player should mostly be able to free themselves of the additional survival difficulty of the pack, at least as far as the overworld goes.

Players will need to craft the first set of metal working machines and greatly improve their manufacturing efficiency. They will mostly rely on a huge steam buffer to power everything, since they won’t be required to build any high power consumption setup running 24/7. However, setting up a proper power gen like oil distillery, would greatly help them proceed.

With the introduction of conveyor and pump covers, automation complexes are finally possible to be built with relative ease, while it’s not really required to do so, given they are not required to make a steady power supply, players should be rewarded accordingly if they do so.


Major milestone:
- Set of metal working machines
- Reach the Twilight Forest
- First EBF
- MV circuits

Major challenges:
- Lack of steel

Optional challenges:
- Conquer overworld dungeons
- 4x or more BBF
- First Oil pumping and processing

End of tier: built first MV machine

Main material: Steel
Secondary material: Wrought Iron
Cable materials: Tin
Pipe materials: Bronze, Potin, Tin

</div>

## 2.iv. MV Age
<div align="justify">
This is when the first multi is introduced (GT++ steam multis not considered). 
The sudden bump in power requirement calls for some real power infra. Oil, benzene or charcoal steam are viable, while oil/benzene being the one preferred.
With a proper power setup, running automation for a considerable timespan is now possible. Classic setups like water electrolysis, redstone centrifuge, automated ore proc, etc are still not required, but would help greatly regardless.
The tier has the first required (mini) chemical line with Solar Grade Silicon.

Major milestone:
- HV Circuits

Major challenges:
- Setting up a non-steam power source or scaling up steam power sufficiently.

Main material: Aluminium
Secondary material: Wrought Iron
Cable materials: Copper, Cupronickel
Pipe material: Steel, Brass
</div>

## 2.v. HV Age
<div align="justify">
The main goal of this tier is to reach the Moon. Many parts lead up to that including IV circuits, the Cleanroom, and the implosion compressor.
The Distillation Tower and Oil Cracker also lead to more advanced oil (or benzene) setups.

Major milestone:
- PTFE and Large Chemical Reactors
- IV Circuits
- Reaching the Moon

Major challenges:
- Working with the Cleanroom

Main material: Stainless Steel
Secondary material: Polyethylene
Cable materials: Gold, Silver, Electrum
Pipe material: Dark Steel

Rocket tier 1, unlocked bodies:
- Moon
</div>

## 2.vi. EV Age
<div align="justify">
EV is the age in which AE2 is unlocked, which is a vital point in any modpack with progression, especially GTNH when it can easily be considered the biggest modpack there is. There are many new automations that are unlocked in EV, which can now be done with AE2. While some of these are often delayed to IV, there is now quite a bit the player can or has to setup in EV.

Required are Platinum, Radon (from Thorium), and a small amount of Tungstensteel, to be able to make the T2 rocket. Also required in the EV progression are Epoxid, Polyphenylene Sulfide, and Graphene.

There are further setups that optional but can be quite useful: IC2 nukes, Ore Processing with multiblocks, and general crafting automations.

Any player can choose to set up AE2 automation in EV, with the main issues being Titanium and power costs, but they can also choose to go to tier 2 planets quickly to automate things in IV instead.

The Titanium processing is not strictly required anymore once on has a Multiblock Miner in a tier 2 planet, because Titanium Small Ore exists there. In the search for Tungstate, Scheelite and other ores, the player might fine they have enough Titanium to no longer need to process Rutile. However, the processing lines for Bauxite and Ilmenite are also very useful for Gallium and Tantalum.

A further challenge in EV is to switch from singleblock generators to multiblock generators and in the process most likely from decentralized power to centralized power.


Main material: Titanium
Secondary material: Polyethylene
Cable materials: Aluminium, Black Steel
Pipe material: Titanium

Rocket tier 2, unlocked bodies:
- Mars
- Deimos
- Phobos

</div>

## 2.vii. IV Age
<div align="justify">
Major milestone:

- Full automations with AE2 and processing multiblocks
- Building the Assembly Line

Major challenges:

- Lack of power
- Extra difficulty in building multiblocks to keep up with needed processing speed
- Automating the entire platline
- Automating PBI and other plastics that are still missing.
- Sourcing required fluids for plastics and platline.
- Progressing through 2 coil tiers to process new materials
- Big jump in EBF processing time with both Tungsten and Tungstensteel
- Large amount of Graphene needed, which require many stacks of processed Silicon
- Obtaining Indium in significant amounts for this tier and the next
- Radon loop from Uranium ores found in t2 planets, if not fully set up in EV

Optional challenges:
- Automating many LuV inputs to be ready in advance
- Investing in powergen to prepare for the gap until fusion
- Getting Naquadah from the EBF recipe for the new wafers
- Monazite line
- Bastnasite line

Main material: Tungstensteel
Secondary material: PTFE
Cable materials: Tungsten, Graphene, Platinum
Pipe material: Tungstensteel

Rocket tier 3, unlocked bodies:
- Ceres
- Asteroids
- Europa
- Ganymede
- Callisto
- Ross128b

Rocket tier 4 (right at the cusp to LuV, could also be seen as LuV), unlocked bodies:
- Io
- Mercury
- Venus

</div>

## 2.viii. LuV Age
<div align="justify">

LuV and ZPM blend into each other a bid as they only have one combined circuit line and are both relatively short. There is probably space here for some additional content.

LuV has the start of the Naquadah line and the first fusion reactor. And after the fusion reactor, CALs and the Crystal circuits.

Major challenges:
- Naquadah line
- high smelting and thus power requirements to craft first fusion reactor
- fully automating the Assembly Line.

Optional challenges:
- Super Glue line

Main material: Rhodium-Plated Palladium
Secondary material: PTFE
Cable materials: Vanadium-Gallium, Yttrium Barium Cuprate
Pipe material: Niobium-Titanium

Rocket tier 5, unlocked bodies:
- Enceladus
- Titan
- Miranda
- Oberon
- Ross128ba

</div>

## 2.ix. ZPM Age
<div align="justify">

LuV and ZPM blend into each other a bid as they only have one combined circuit line and are both relatively short.

Current ZPM content is mainly to finish the Naquadah line and to make a Mk II Fusion reactor. There is certainly space here for some additional content.

Major challenges:
- one needs to ramp up sufficient power and smelting capabilities for Neutronium.

Main material: Iridium
Secondary material: PBI
Cable materials: Naquadah, Vanadium-Gallium, Europium
Pipe material: Enderium

Rocket tier 6, unlocked bodies:
- Oberon
- Triton
</div>

## 2.x. UV Age
<div align="justify">

In UV players delve into Bioprocesses, figure out TecTech Computing and Research, and make mk III fusion.

Optional goals are the PCB Factory (very worthwhile), the Space Elevator (at the end, probably more UHV), and Compact Fusion (probably often UHV).

As fusion power from Helium Plasma does not scale in XL turbines, the player also has to look into power options (Nq fuels, advanced fusion fuels).

Main material: Osmium
Secondary material: PBI
Cable materials: Naquadah Alloy, Americium, Fluxed Electrum
Pipe material: Naquadah

Rocket tier 7, unlocked bodies:
- Pluto
- Kuiper Belt
- Haumea
- Makemake

</div>

## 2.xi. UHV Age
<div align="justify">
GT++ Cyclotron required here, rejig some of the lower tier usages of the items and then we have access to particles for higher tier circuits, machines etc.

Other content here are Bio-circuits, Infinity, a Botmium Chemplant for Living Solder, 2 rocket tiers, and the first creative tier items.

The player is challenged to build a Mothership, a multiblock spaceship which can be accessed by launching a Shuttle Rocket. It is used to reach the farest system, the Ra-System.

In the process the player also requires Kevlar (which is not in an interesting/satisfying state currently, just spam of basic low tier multis). Another plastic to look at the same time is Radox polymer based on Xenoxene.

Furthermore the Space Elevator multiblock can be built, which allows the player to mine in space from asteroids from the comfort of their base. At first only allowing resources from tier 7 planets and below. It also allows the player to pump fluids from distant planets. The elevator can have a module installed, which allows the making of projects in space, like an asteroid outpost or the start of a dyson swarm.

The tier usually also includes a drastic up-scaling of power and processing capabilities to keep up with demand which is a current part of all tiers after UHV as well.

New assembly line-type multiblock possibly.

Space Elevator
The Space Elevator is a tall multiblock structure that allows the user to construct large scale space projects.
Use Cases:
- Crafting of the Matrioshka Brain
- Maybe integration with the Dyson Swarm?
- A theoretical space station used for crafting items that need low gravity (ZBLAN) (to make this have a bigger use, we could 1. Introduce more recipes that need low gravity and 2. Blacklist machines from applying that effect when not in a low gravity environment)
- Integration with space ship building?
- Let players travel to other planets?
- Space Mining?
Other ideas:
- The Space Elevator has some kind of project hatch. In this hatch you can insert a data stick for the project you want to start. In the hatch you will also see needed materials and progress. Once the project is finished it will be saved in the controller (like the imprint of a CAL) to allow the user to do recipes on the project. A simple example could be that a user builds a virtual space station inside the elevator. Now the user can input items for recipes that need a space station and the elevator will process them.

## 2.xv. UXV Age
<div align="justify">
(Former) Black Hole Generator
A multiblock used for both energy and resource generation. The idea is to create different types of stellar objects to achieve this. Different types of stellar objects can be unlocked by using the Dyson Swarm to research stars. Dyson Swarm could have two modes, first being normal power generation, second being research mode. Both modes could have different drone types? Would need to decide on the maths behind this.
Name ideas:

- Hammerspace Containment Device
- Star Forge
- 
Tiered casings of the multi are:
- Hammerspace Containment Units (Determine input volume)
- “Time Acceleration Device” (Determine process time)
- Maybe tiered casings of the multi itself, that have different heat values they can withstand (Determine max. processable star type). The original structure had a glass-dome version. Maybe we could use different tiers of containment glass. (Honestly I think the glass should be removed, it looks way better without it imo).

Possible use cases: 
- Create a star from “Gas Giant Composite Gas” that is harvested on gas giants and other resources. 
- Stars can then be processed further to die. When dying the star creates a supernova, which creates a black hole and generates a lot of plasma/energy in the process. Black holes can be processed further (possibly in another machine) to generate more energy.

Open questions: 
- How could a star be transported (item form would be possible but maybe there is a more fitting way of transporting a star). 
- Which amounts of plasma/energy should the stars give to fit into the balancing.
- Could take in continuous amounts of mass each second from a hatch.

Other ideas:
- If the stars are created under intense time acceleration, maybe they shouldn’t just be processed and be done. Instead Let them age over time and the player is to decide when the star is done. At each different age the outcomes of processing the star further may vary.
- The generator could need computation to work.
- Can craft Neutron stars, Magnetars, main sequence, red dwarfs, blue giants, hyper giants, brown dwarfs, black hole, white dwarf (multi-step process to get some of these as they are only formed after a supernova has occurred).
- Crafting process: 
    - Fill the machine with a lot of gas (Gas Giant Composite Gas was suggested but maybe Hydrogen and Helium?), maybe dust/mass and apply a huge amount of energy (internal buffer perhaps, like fusion) to create an interstellar cloud as a first step.
    - To actually now get to the star little energy is required for the upkeep of the machine. This process will take some time. 
    - From what I understand a star needs no further input to evolve into other star-classes except time. So maybe just consume energy. We could also add some stuff here to increase the challenge (maybe something like the uncertainty resolver but for stars)

## 2.xvi. MAX Age
<div align="justify">
Black Hole Generator Mk2 (?)
This machine follows the same principles as the normal Black Hole Generator, discussed above. However instead of dealing with single stars you create a whole microverse.
Ideas:

- You need to find a balance in your microverse in terms of black holes, stars and whatnot (Entropy as measure?).
- Need wormhole multi to connect to basement universes for resource harvesting? Perhaps the multi itself makes an item which can “connect” to this universe through the wormhole generator, then users can harvest multiple universes in parallel with different wormhole multis. This multi already exists in TT with no implemented logic.
- Crafting empty basement universes and inserting computational equipment and using this in MAX tier circuits (Perhaps even a multi to assemble matrioshka brains in “orbit” and insert them into basement universes). See tipler oracles.
- Space elevator multiblock? 
- Allow multiple dyson swarms spanning multiple star systems.
