## Thaumcraft Age 3: Eldritch and Basic Automation 
- (Late HV / Early EV)

### Vision on the tier:
- Technically, a player doesn’t ever actually have to achieve this age, many will actually go down this path after they finish the next one, however, the Primordial Pearl and the Eldritch tab as a whole gate some of the most useful magic content in the pack, so any player would be remiss to go through the struggles of magic and not finish the race.

### Major unlocks/rewards:
- Quite literally opens up a new world of magic to the player, the Eldritch Dimension (the Outer Lands)
- Primordial Pearl + uses
- Void Metal
- Essentia Reservoir for easier essentia pipe usage

### Major milestone(s):
- Eldritch Epiphany (26 warp, perm + normal)
- Eldritch Revelations (51 warp, perm + normal)
- Eldritch Dimension (the Outer Lands)
- Void Metal creation
- Primordial Pearl

### Major challenge(s):
- Warp management if the player didn’t utilise “normal/sticky” warp to achieve
- The Eldritch Dimension is annoying, it's a maze

### Major limitations(s):
- You still don't have AE yet, so automation is awful

### Optional challenge(s):
- Creation of the plantable Void Seed from Thaumic Bases

### End of tier:
- Player obtains Thaumic Energistics

### Main materials:
- Void Metal
- Primordial Pearls
