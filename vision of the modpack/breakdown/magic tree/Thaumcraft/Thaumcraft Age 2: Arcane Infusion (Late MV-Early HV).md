## Thaumcraft Age 2: Arcane Infusion 
- (Late MV/ Early HV)


### Vision on the tier:
- The player starts to actually feel the usefulness of magick as their world dramatically expands with the advent of infusion
- Vastly opens up the player’s repertoire of capability and content, likewise increasing complexity, the main unlock of this stage is the aforementioned infusion, a new crafting mechanic that gates major concepts in the QoL of the pack as a whole, such as being the gating for majorly sought out TEs such as the Thaumic Restorer

### Major unlocks/rewards:
- Unlocks Scepters and Staffs (can be done earlier with profaned wand though)
- Goggles of Revealing
- Energizing Nodes
- Boots of the Traveller + variants


### Major milestone(s):
- Unlocking Infusion
- Unlocking the use of the Thaumatorium (technically this is MV)

### Major challenge(s):
- Actually learning the system of infusion, as well as the stability
- Figuring out proper sources for all of the essentials, far past what little you use in the crucible


### Major limitations(s):
- A continuation of the vis limitation, though the discounts open up supremely here
- Matrix stability
- Material limitations

### Optional challenge(s):
- Full stability altar
- Properly learning the essentia pipe system
- Basic material automation through the Thaumatorium


### End of tier: …
- Player unlocks the “Eldritch” tab

### Main materials:
