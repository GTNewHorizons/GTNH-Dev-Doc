## Blood Magic Age 1: HV Tier

### Vision for the tier:
In HV the player can start to dabble in Blood Magic. This is just the start and the initial payoffs are weak. But the player can start progressing through the first tiers of BM.

### Major milestone(s):
- With some very basic Witchery, the main Thaumcraft content from LV/MV, and an Implosion Compressor, the player can start with Blood magic.
- Weak Orb and Apprentice Orb.
- Blood Altar Tier 1-3
- Alchemic Chemistry crafting
- Basic rituals

### Major unlocks/rewards:
- ???

### Content of Blood Magic Addons:
- ???

### Major challenge(s):
- Warp Management. At this point the player might start to be interested in various warp research to progress in BM and its addons so they need to either deal with the consequences or invest in some mitigation.

### Optional challenge(s):
- ???

### Main materials:
- ???
