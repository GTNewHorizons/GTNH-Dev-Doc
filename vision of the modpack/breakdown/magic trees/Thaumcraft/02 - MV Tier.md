## Thaumcraft Age 1: MV Tier


### Vision for the tier:
- LV and MV are pretty small introductory sections but even a smaller dive into magic already yields useful rewards.
- - The very first “tier” realistically achievable, opens up the world of magic to the player, providing much QoL even early on, this is where the basics should be.
- - The basic novice tier. A first dive into magic becomes possible in the later parts of LV once the player reaches the Twilight Forest and obtains some Aluminum from their first EBF.
