## Thaumcraft Age 1: MV Tier


### Vision for the tier:
- LV and MV are pretty small introductory sections but even a smaller dive into magic already yields useful rewards.
- The very first “tier” realistically achievable, opens up the world of magic to the player, providing much QoL even early on, this is where the basics should be.
- The basic novice tier. A first dive into magic becomes possible in the later parts of LV once the player reaches the Twilight Forest and obtains some Aluminum from their first EBF. But we will discuss that together with MV here.
