## Thaumcraft Age 2: HV Tier

### Vision for the tier:
- The player starts to actually feel the usefulness of magick as their world dramatically expands with the advent of infusion
- - Vastly opens up the player’s repertoire of capability and content, likewise increasing complexity, the main unlock of this stage is the aforementioned infusion, a new crafting mechanic that gates major concepts in the QoL of the pack as a whole, such as being the gating for majorly sought out TEs such as the Thaumic Restorer
- HV is the magic adept tier. A lot of things are now available to the player.
- - Technically, a player doesn’t ever actually have to achieve this age, many will actually go down this path after they finish the next one, however, the Primordial Pearl and the Eldritch tab as a whole gate some of the most useful magic content in the pack, so any player would be remiss to go through the struggles of magic and not finish the race.

### Wand tier unlocked:
- Greatwood wand based on Stainless Steel. (remark: the screws are already available for the next wand but not the cores, probably want to adjust the screws a bit)
- Elemental, 
- Transmutative, 
- Thaumium wand based on Energetic Alloy (already MV) 
- Then Silverwood wand based on Vibrant Alloy Screws. 
- Void
- Blood
- Livingwood
- Dreamwood
- Witchwood
- Blood Infused Wand seem to available with current screws.

### Content of Thaumcraft Addons:
- ???

### Major challenge(s):
- Actually learning the system of infusion, as well as the stability
- Figuring out proper sources for all of the essentials, far past what little you use in the crucible
- Warp management if the player didn’t utilise “normal/sticky” warp to achieve
- The Eldritch Dimension is annoying, it's a maze
- Warp Management. At this point the player might start to be interested in various warp research so they need to either deal with the consequences or invest in some mitigation.


### Major limitations(s):
- A continuation of the vis limitation, though the discounts open up supremely here
- Matrix stability
- Material limitations
- You still don't have AE yet, so automation is awful

### Optional challenge(s):
- Full stability altar
- Properly learning the essentia pipe system
- Basic material automation through the Thaumatorium
- Creation of the plantable Void Seed from Thaumic Bases

### Main materials:
- Stainless Steel
- Lich Bones
- Void Metal
- Primordial Pearls
