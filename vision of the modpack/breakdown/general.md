# 1. What is GT:NH?
<div align="justify">
You are looking at a big progressive highly integrated expert mode pack for Minecraft 1.7.10 centered around the mod GregTech.

With over 8 years of development (and still going) GT:NH has formed a balance and refinement that only a handful of packs can keep up with. We are talking about thousands of recipe tweaks, a massive questbook with a custom reward system, unique world generation, custom mods coded for the pack, custom Thaumonomicon pages, and many more.

The main intentions of the pack are a long-lasting experience and tying mods together in a progressive fashion, making it feel more like a single game than a compilation of mods thrown together.

To reach this goal, GT New Horizons is using the tiers (basically ages of technology) from GregTech and allocates content of other mods to a fitting point within the progression.

Starting in the stone age you will barely be able to survive until you get your first steam machines and, eventually, reach electricity. Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.

If you are a fan of expert mode packs and want to take it to the next level this pack will be your friend!
</div>

# 2. What is a tier?
<div align="justify">
Large parts of the content in GT:NH is structured around the voltage tiers of GregTech. The questbook also has separate tabs following these tiers. They represent the main progression in the pack.

When you reach a new tier, you often unlock new machines and new processes, and maybe new blocks and items that can help you with automation, exploration, or survival. The tiers then (often) culminate in a new dimension/planet you visit or a new complicated machine or process that allows you to get new materials to build the requirements for the next tier.

Circuit tiers are relatively well defined but don’t really correspond to voltage tiers in a one-to-one way (a machine may have an LV hull and take an MV circuit, and in HV you build IV circuits).

Another common theme is materials that are hard to get in one tier (for example, only available as small ore, need strange processing, etc) become easier to obtain in a later tier. Tungsten for example. However, it is likely that  the “easier” path needs an appropriate line - you can get small amounts of platinum but you’re going to need a platline eventually.

Tier materials are used to gate content, by requiring a titanium plate, for example, a thaumcraft item can be restricted until you can obtain at least some titanium.
</div>

# 3. What should be Magic?
<div align="justify">
Magic is concepts and mechanisms tailored under a magic theme. Instead of the “tech” they focus more on utility than progressing through the tiers. Examples are armor, tools, survival, teleport and whatnot.

Magic can assist in progressing through the tiers, but it should not be the primary gating mechanism of any tier (unless this tier is solely for more advanced magic). In simpler terms, one should be able to reach the end of the tech tree without doing any magic.

Advancement in Tech should assist in the development of magic, e.g. a ZPM player should receive some kind of boost to speed up/catch up development in magic if he wanted to. Do note these boosts should not eventually give birth to the meme of Hold off doing magic until UHV when you get to one click unlock everything.

Magic Mods should be kept relatively distinct, with optional cross-over instead of treating everything as a Thaumcraft Addon and requiring Infusion (as an example).
</div>

# 4. What should be space exploration?
<div align="justify">
From GitHub: “Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.”

Currently you go to space to get plans for the next rocket and to get minerals (no-rocket-runs to the side).

Question: Are no-rocket-runs an intended path for the pack?
</div>

## 4.i. Yannick suggestion: Leapfrogging

<div align="justify">
In order to reach ever further into space, you need to build a network of space stations and ground stations with launch and refueling facilities. Basically encourage having to build some kind of a presence on those worlds. Those outposts could be thought of as a level of complexity above multis because they need to be mini-bases, and each tier should have new requirements to keep the challenge fresh.

You could also gate more mod content behind those planets. Could portals to certain dimensions only be openable from the right planets? Could certain aspects of magic mods also only exist in other worlds? Getting players to play longer on each planet gives you an opportunity to do stuff like having tougher mobs on every tier, to give a use to your ever more powerful offensive capabilities.

# 5. What is the place of combat in the pack?
<div align=justify>

</div>


# 6. What is Tedium?
<div>
A process that is required but is not fun. Something may be fun to figure out the first time (redstone anti-void for a multiblock) but soon becomes tedious the fifty-seventh time you have to set it up on an LCR. This can be solved by tiering (for example, maintenance hatches go from manual to duct tape to toolboxes to automated to fully automated).

A process that is long and RNG filled. Crops for example are generally considered more tedious than bees, because you have to babysit them and wait for RNG. Splitting up the steps necessary may help (many people don’t do anything crop or bee until they NEED something) - so making it desirable to do some of the basics earlier could reduce that load.

A process that only prevents a negative aspect. Warp, for example, is balanced by the good things you’re getting (and can be avoided by avoiding those things), but pollution solution has “no advantage” except reduction of negative effects, and so many disable it.

A process that encourages extensive AFK so machines can run. You could survive on a single BBF, but it should be encouraged to instead build more. This can be at odds with other tedium as often you can avoid certain tedium by just setting something up and letting it run AFK.

A process the user has to do to get the best gameplay, but isn’t directly part of the game. For example, marking waypoints for ores, nodes, etc.

A boss fight that is extremely long but without any skill, damaging them for three points a hit for five hours.

Should tedium be accepted/permitted for situations “outside of normal gameplay” - for example, is tedium associated with a no-rocket-run acceptable?
</div>

# 7. What is QoL?
<div align="justify">
Quality of Life is often using the pack code to automate “tedium” away - for example before VisualProspecting almost everyone would manually waypoint ore locations - something that is handled by VisualProspecting.

Tools like NEI are an important part of QoL as it helps you find what you need.

Additional QoL items include the questbook which lets you know about new things that can help your playthrough, along with UI improvements that reveal functionality.

QoL should usually not be gated behind some certain tier. Trying to do so must have a strong rationale behind it to justify it, e.g. the QoL completely eliminates a previous mechanism (though at that point it’d be worth considering if this existing mechanism needs tweaking)
</div>

# 8. What's our policy to add new mods?
<div align="justify">
All new mods must be Open Source with few-to-no exceptions.
Large mods must not only be “thematically appropriate” but also have a champion willing to work with the team both on development and balance.
Unless (and perhaps even) if actively under development, a fork shall be created in our repo.
</div>

# 9. What is the deprecation policy on removed or "nerfed" recipes?
<div align="justify">
Many if not most players don’t follow GitHub development closely, and can be surprised by changes such as new lines (Aluminum, eg). This can result in already existing lines having to be revisited, which can be tedious. 

Perhaps there should be a two step process:
New line is added with additional steps vs current setup (but also advantages of some kind). Previous recipes are hidden in NEI but remain functional. QB is updated (perhaps there should be an in-game QB chapter for major changes?)
Next release the recipes are removed

This wouldn’t apply to unintentional recipes/exploits
</div>

# 10. General Principles
- Avoid small/tiny dusts if possible - percentage chance of full dusts instead
- Avoid making new features that encourage spamming laggy setup.
