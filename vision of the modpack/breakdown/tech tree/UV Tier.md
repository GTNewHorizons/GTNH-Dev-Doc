## UV Tier
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
In UV players delve into Bioprocesses, figure out TecTech Computing and Research, and make mk III fusion.

Optional goals are the PCB Factory (very worthwhile), the Space Elevator (at the end, probably more UHV), and Compact Fusion (probably often UHV).

As fusion power from Helium Plasma does not scale in XL turbines, the player also has to look into power options (Nq fuels, advanced fusion fuels).
