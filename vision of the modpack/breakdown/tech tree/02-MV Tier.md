## 2.iv. MV Age
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
This tier unlocks two important machines at the start: the MV Electrolyzer can produce large amounts of Alumina Dust, which is much harder to get in LV; the MV Extruder, which unlocks all the useful extruding recipes that make processing even cheaper and easier, particularly with pipes, gears and other materials. 

The sudden bump in power requirement calls for some real power infrastructure. Oil, Benzene or Charcoal to Steam are viable, while Oil/Benzene being the preferred ones. With a proper power setup, running automation for a considerable timespan is now possible, and this is the first tier for most players where many machines are chained into fully automated setups. Classic setups like Water electrolysis, Redstone centrifuge, automated ore processing, etc. are still not required, but would help greatly regardless.

The tier has the first required (mini) chemical line with Solar Grade Silicon, alongside other optional chemical lines which give more and more use to the Chemical Reactor, which is later replaced by the LCR in the next tier.

- First the Coal Jetpack, then the Copterpack.
