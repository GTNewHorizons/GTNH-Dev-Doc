## 2.iii. LV Age
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
By this point the player should mostly be able to free themselves of the additional survival difficulty of the pack, at least as far as the overworld goes.

Players will need to craft the first set of metal working machines and greatly improve their manufacturing efficiency. Many of the new machines improve the crafts that were already done before, like the Wiremill, Lathe, Bending Machine and others. At the same time as LV players unlock new crafts, they have to understand how to make older crafts easier, one of the biggest examples being the LV circuit, which goes through several stages of crafting ease as more LV machines are available.

They will mostly rely on a huge steam buffer to power everything, since they won’t be required to build any high power consumption setup running 24/7. However, setting up a proper power gen like oil distillery, would greatly help them proceed. The EBF is a soft wall to Steam power, because of the lower efficiency of Steam Turbines, which can force the EBF to shut down due to not having enough power and voiding precious materials. New players at this stage are generally advised to move away from Steam, to make their first EBF setup more manageable.

With the introduction of conveyor and pump covers, automation complexes are finally possible to be built with relative ease, while it’s not really required to do so, given they are not required to make a steady power supply, players should be rewarded accordingly if they do so. In this tier, however, these covers are necessary for machines, and they are often too expensive to be used in large numbers.
