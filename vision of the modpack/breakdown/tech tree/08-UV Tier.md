## UV Tier
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
In UV players delve into Bioprocesses, figure out TecTech Computing and Research, and make mk III fusion.

Optional goals are the PCB Factory (very worthwhile), the Space Elevator (at the end, probably more UHV), and Compact Fusion (probably often UHV).

As fusion power from Helium Plasma does not scale in XL turbines, the player also has to look into power options (Nq fuels, advanced fusion fuels).


**Major unlocks/rewards**:
- Lasers and active Transformer
- PCB Factory

**Major milestone(s)**:
- Research Station
- Wetware Circuits

**Major challenge(s)**:
- Dealing with the Biolab.
- Automating the Biovat
- Setting up the Quantum Computer and Research Station

**Optional challenge(s)**:
- Optimizing the Quantum Computer
- Potentially make a Space Elevator or a Compact Fusion reactor towards the end of the tier.
- Kevlar Line. (not in a great state, needs a rework or improvements)

**End of tier**: Obtain Cosmic Neutronium and Bedrockium, make a UHV circuit, and make your first UHV parts.

**Main material**: Osmium

**Secondary material(s)**:
- PBI

**Cable materials**:
- Naquadah Alloy
- Americium
- Fluxed Electrum

**Pipe materials**:
- Naquadah

**Rocket tier unlocked**: 7

**Unlocked bodies**:
- Pluto
- Kuiper Belt
- Haumea
- Makemake
