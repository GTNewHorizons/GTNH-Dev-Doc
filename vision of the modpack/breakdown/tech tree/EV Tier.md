## 2.vi. EV Age
<div align="justify">
EV is the age in which AE2 is unlocked, which is a vital point in any modpack with progression, especially GTNH when it can easily be considered the biggest modpack there is. There are many new automations that are unlocked in EV, which can now be done with AE2. While some of these are often delayed to IV, there is now quite a bit the player can or has to setup in EV.

Required are Platinum, Radon (from Thorium), and a small amount of Tungstensteel, to be able to make the T2 rocket. Also required in the EV progression are Epoxid, Polyphenylene Sulfide, and Graphene.

There are further setups that optional but can be quite useful: IC2 nukes, Ore Processing with multiblocks, and general crafting automations.

Any player can choose to set up AE2 automation in EV, with the main issues being Titanium and power costs, but they can also choose to go to tier 2 planets quickly to automate things in IV instead.

The Titanium processing is not strictly required anymore once on has a Multiblock Miner in a tier 2 planet, because Titanium Small Ore exists there. In the search for Tungstate, Scheelite and other ores, the player might fine they have enough Titanium to no longer need to process Rutile. However, the processing lines for Bauxite and Ilmenite are also very useful for Gallium and Tantalum.

A further challenge in EV is to switch from singleblock generators to multiblock generators and in the process most likely from decentralized power to centralized power. For that the LSC (Lapotronic Supercapacitor) becomes available at the end of EV as well.
