This is the player’s first exposure to the pack and its philosophies, so it is important to ensure that any information is as clear as it can be.

In this tier, the player is introduced to tool progression and how it applies to mining. Also present is the player’s first exposure to GT ore veins.

It is worth noting that the player will find themselves almost 100% relying on the Quest Book to figure out what to do next for the early survival portions of this tier.
