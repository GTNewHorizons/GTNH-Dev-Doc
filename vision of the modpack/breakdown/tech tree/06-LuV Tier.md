## LuV Tier
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
LuV and ZPM blend into each other a bid as they only have one combined circuit line and are both relatively short. There is probably space here for some additional content.

LuV has the start of the Naquadah line and the first fusion reactor. And after the fusion reactor, CALs and the Crystal circuits.


**Major unlocks/rewards**:
- Precise Assembler to drastically speed up assembler crafting
- Circuit Assembly Line to drastically speed up circuit crafting
- Electric Prospector Scanner
- Crafting Input Bus
- Auto Maintenance Hatch
- Ender Fluid Link Cover

**Major milestone(s)**:
- Naquadah Line (Naquadah)
- Fusion reactor
- Circuit Assembly Lines
