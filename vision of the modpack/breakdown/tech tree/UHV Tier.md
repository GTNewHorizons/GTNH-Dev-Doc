## UV Tier
<div align="justify">

**vision on the tier**:
GT++ Cyclotron required here, rejig some of the lower tier usages of the items and then we have access to particles for higher tier circuits, machines etc.

Other content here are Bio-circuits, Infinity, a Botmium Chemplant for Living Solder, 2 rocket tiers, and the first creative tier items.

The player is challenged to build a Mothership, a multiblock spaceship which can be accessed by launching a Shuttle Rocket. It is used to reach the farest system, the Ra-System.

In the process the player also requires Kevlar (which is not in an interesting/satisfying state currently, just spam of basic low tier multis). Another plastic to look at the same time is Radox polymer based on Xenoxene.

Furthermore the Space Elevator multiblock can be built, which allows the player to mine in space from asteroids from the comfort of their base. At first only allowing resources from tier 7 planets and below. It also allows the player to pump fluids from distant planets. The elevator can have a module installed, which allows the making of projects in space, like an asteroid outpost or the start of a dyson swarm.

The tier usually also includes a drastic up-scaling of power and processing capabilities to keep up with demand which is a current part of all tiers after UHV as well.
