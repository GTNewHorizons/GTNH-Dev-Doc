**vision on the tier**:
(Former) Black Hole Generator
A multiblock used for both energy and resource generation. The idea is to create different types of stellar objects to achieve this. Different types of stellar objects can be unlocked by using the Dyson Swarm to research stars. Dyson Swarm could have two modes, first being normal power generation, second being research mode. Both modes could have different drone types? Would need to decide on the maths behind this.
Name ideas:

- Hammerspace Containment Device
- Star Forge
-
Tiered casings of the multi are:
- Hammerspace Containment Units (Determine input volume)
- “Time Acceleration Device” (Determine process time)
- Maybe tiered casings of the multi itself, that have different heat values they can withstand (Determine max. processable star type). The original structure had a glass-dome version. Maybe we could use different tiers of containment glass. (Honestly I think the glass should be removed, it looks way better without it imo).

Possible use cases:
- Create a star from “Gas Giant Composite Gas” that is harvested on gas giants and other resources.
- Stars can then be processed further to die. When dying the star creates a supernova, which creates a black hole and generates a lot of plasma/energy in the process. Black holes can be processed further (possibly in another machine) to generate more energy.

Open questions:
- How could a star be transported (item form would be possible but maybe there is a more fitting way of transporting a star).
- Which amounts of plasma/energy should the stars give to fit into the balancing.
- Could take in continuous amounts of mass each second from a hatch.

Other ideas:
- If the stars are created under intense time acceleration, maybe they shouldn’t just be processed and be done. Instead Let them age over time and the player is to decide when the star is done. At each different age the outcomes of processing the star further may vary.
- The generator could need computation to work.
- Can craft Neutron stars, Magnetars, main sequence, red dwarfs, blue giants, hyper giants, brown dwarfs, black hole, white dwarf (multi-step process to get some of these as they are only formed after a supernova has occurred).
- Crafting process:
  - Fill the machine with a lot of gas (Gas Giant Composite Gas was suggested but maybe Hydrogen and Helium?), maybe dust/mass and apply a huge amount of energy (internal buffer perhaps, like fusion) to create an interstellar cloud as a first step.
  - To actually now get to the star little energy is required for the upkeep of the machine. This process will take some time.
  - From what I understand a star needs no further input to evolve into other star-classes except time. So maybe just consume energy. We could also add some stuff here to increase the challenge (maybe something like the uncertainty resolver but for stars)
