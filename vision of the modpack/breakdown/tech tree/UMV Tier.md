New assembly line-type multiblock possibly.

Space Elevator
The Space Elevator is a tall multiblock structure that allows the user to construct large scale space projects.
Use Cases:
- Crafting of the Matrioshka Brain
- Maybe integration with the Dyson Swarm?
- A theoretical space station used for crafting items that need low gravity (ZBLAN) (to make this have a bigger use, we could 1. Introduce more recipes that need low gravity and 2. Blacklist machines from applying that effect when not in a low gravity environment)
- Integration with space ship building?
- Let players travel to other planets?
- Space Mining?
  Other ideas:
- The Space Elevator has some kind of project hatch. In this hatch you can insert a data stick for the project you want to start. In the hatch you will also see needed materials and progress. Once the project is finished it will be saved in the controller (like the imprint of a CAL) to allow the user to do recipes on the project. A simple example could be that a user builds a virtual space station inside the elevator. Now the user can input items for recipes that need a space station and the elevator will process them.
