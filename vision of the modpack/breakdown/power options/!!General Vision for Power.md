# General Vision for Power

This is our general vision for power production in GTNH.

## Different Power Options for Different Tiers

We want the player to use multiple different power options as they progress from the start of the game to the end. The same power source with broadly the same setup should typically not be good for more than around 2-3 tiers.

## Having Alternatives

We want the player to have multiple alternative options for power generation at each stage of the game. All with their own advantages. For now options are however more limited in the later tiers of the pack.

## Against Repetitive Spam

Power generation should not just be repetitive spam of the same setup over and over. While this might be hard to avoid in late tiers, this should at least be considered when rebalancing any power source. However if there are people spamming a simple power generation option, that does not necessarily mean there needs to be immediate change, as long as there exists a better alternative that involves less spam.

## Power Metrics

Precise power metrics to compare various power sources are difficult. Broadly speaking the most important number to compare power options at a given tier is the quotient of the effective power divided by the cost of the setup. The effective power of a setup is usually easy to compute as the output eu/t subtracted by the eu/t needed to run the setup. The cost of the setup however is much harder to quantify, it consists mainly of the amount of machines and their individual cost.

## Beyond power metrics: Rewarding Complexity and Challenge

Simpler Power Setups should always be less powerful than more complex ones, see above in 'Against Repetitive Spam'. Other types of difficulty that can be rewarded with a bit more power are automation challenges or the need to dive deep into certain optional mods. If the setup itself is extremely simple, one option is to push the complexity and challenge towards the crafting of the machines involved (see for example tech-based solar power).

## Beyond power metrics: Byproducts and Synergies

Another point to look at when considering the strength of a power source, are byproducts and other synergies. The production of a fuel can yield valuable byproducts that are useful for the rest of the base or the fuel might be useful for more than just power. Other synergies to consider could be the ease to upgrade the setup to future tiers or from past tiers, or how well the power source works with very uneven energy demand (pre UHV capacitor or even pre LSC).
